	<h2>3D Modeling and Fabrication</h2>
		<h3> 
			In the spring semester of 2023, I took my first 3-D modeling class. This project is the product of many design iterations in Rhino 7. The final model is based on a singular object I designed in Rhino earlier in the semester. The original object (first three images) reminded me of both a spiky futuristic spaceship and a lotus flower. I decided to build off of the flower theme in order to model my final project. I have become increasingly fascinated with biomimicry and used this design method to fuel the project. I made multiple duplicates of my initial object, connecting them together and rotating them in ways I found interesting. In nature, although every individual life form is different, plant structures are filled with symmetrical patterns. For that reason, I felt that duplicates of the same object was the best way to deliver a biomimicry piece.
