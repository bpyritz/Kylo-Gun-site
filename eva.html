		<h3> Biological Clock </h3>
			<p> Despite progressive movements of feminism in recent decades, there are still waves of individuals or groups who believe women are meant for a life of motherhood no matter the circumstances, and even further, that their fertility has an expiration date. What inspired this piece the most was hearing modern depictions, through formats such as podcasts and video, of the thoughts of young men, or even women holding internalized misogyny, who promote the idea that a woman has what is called a “biological clock” that is always ticking. What this phrase means is that a woman should give birth before a certain age to ensure that she is still young and desirable enough to conceive, and that she is still physically able to conceive biological children. Despite this myth of fertility having an expiration date being scientifically proven false, the societal pressure still continues. I represented this in my piece by including physical symbols such as a ticking clock and fruit to represent fertility recurring throughout the video. Being someone directly affected by the expectation to live a life I don’t want, I wanted to create a piece to express the feelings of doom and anger that these expectations yield to me; something that others in this position can relate to, and something for those not in this position to understand the daunting-ness and dark emotions that come with these sexist ideas being spread. I thought the most accurate way to represent that is through a surrealist horror piece.

			<h3>Mirror Me</h3>
			<p>I often find myself caught up comparing myself to others, especially people I know in my personal life. Sometimes I catch myself “copying” what someone wears or a certain hairstyle out of envy. I’ve done this at different points in my life and if I realize that I’m modeling myself after them, it can feel like I’m subtly losing my mind. This piece consists of a character copying everything the other character does in the previous shot to show the subtle ways that emulating another person through everyday tasks can build up even more insecurity and desperation. The piece captures and exaggerates my descent into madness caused by trying to make myself into someone else. I went about this project through my favorite style of video, surrealism, as seen by the dramatic ending.
