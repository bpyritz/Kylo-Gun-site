	<h2>.NET (Not Everything is True)</h2>
		<h3> 
			In ASU’s Fall ‘22 semester, Media Arts & Sciences majors Bailey Pyritz, Aidan White, and Luke Buneo began visualizing and prototyping the multi-media project that would become .NET, or .Not Everything is True. .NET is an immersive city scape with a user-controlled projection aiming to promote critical thinking among viewers about media bias. This project was brought to life by constructing an immersive city-scape room with storefronts, a fence, a small park area, and a projection as the main attraction. Spectators are able to interact with the video playing on the projection by controlling a slider, which is our user interface. Through the slider, users will be able to scrub through clips that will additionally change the sound and lighting in the room. Multiple speakers all around the room and 16 Phillips Hue bulbs were used to attain this goal.

			.NET was part of the Digital Culture Showcase of 2023.
