	<h2>Deep Blue Sea</h2>
		<h3> 
			This was the final project for my class Electroacoustic Music with Max/MSP. 
			<br>
			I knew I wanted to do a bass and vocal piece for this project, and when I was putting together a patch and using some of my favorite Max/MSP effects, I noticed that they all reminded me of the ocean. The randomized delay line sounds like bubbling and the use of pitch tracking to create a cosine wave that mimics the input reminded me of whale calls. Deciding to roll with the ocean theme, I added sound effects in the form of audio samples that you would hear in or around the sea, such as seagulls, waves, whales, and sea lions. These samples are triggered by certain bass notes that I play throughout the piece. To further the potential of the patch, I added reverb plugins for both the bass and vocal inputs and added a cross filter and tremolo looper to the bass that reverse-plays a live recording triggered by a bass note. In songwriting, I tried to write bass parts and lyrics that capture the way I view the sea: mysterious and beautiful.  I hope my vision of the ocean comes through in the piece.
